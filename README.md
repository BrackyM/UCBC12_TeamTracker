# Braxton M | UCBC12_TeamTracker | README

The objective of this Team Profile Generator is to learn more around SQL by creating a database through `MySQL Workbench` that allows you to view a company and their departments, roles, managers, employees, and wages. The options presented in the menu allow you to add or remove these variables within the database.

This allowed for a better understanding and practice of SQL and the components that drive the application. The project used the `seed.sql` and `schema.sql` to create the initial database of information for the menu to change.


## Acceptance Criteria
